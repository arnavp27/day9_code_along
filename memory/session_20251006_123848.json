  "final_answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to polish their answer for a final presentation about creating a Python quiz for \"intens\" (which I now know is likely a typo for \"interviews\"). They need it clear, concise, and well-structured.\n\nLooking at the draft answer they provided, I see it's quite technical but has some issues. The term \"intens\" is confusing - in tech contexts, this almost always means \"interviews\" (especially given their previous failed evaluations). The draft explains this clearly but could be more presentation-friendly.\n\nHmm... the user is probably preparing for a technical presentation where they need to demonstrate this quiz solution. They want to avoid any confusion about the term \"intens\" (which caused their previous failures) and show a practical implementation that actually works.\n\nI should focus on:\n- Making the \"intens\" clarification super clear upfront (since this caused their failures)\n- Cutting down the technical jargon while keeping it precise\n- Adding a strong \"why this works\" section to address their past issues\n- Using bullet points for scannability (presentations need this)\n- Ending with a confident, actionable conclusion\n\nThe draft has good technical content but is too dense for a presentation. I'll restructure it as:\n1. Quick clarification (1 sentence max)\n2. 3-step implementation (with why each step fixes their failures)\n3. Troubleshooting section (only the critical fixes they need)\n4. Punchy conclusion\n\nAlso noting they mentioned \"final presentation\" - so I'll avoid code snippets in the main text and put them in a separate appendix if needed. The focus should be on the *why* behind the solution, not the code.\n\nMost importantly: Their previous evaluations failed because they didn't have the right dependencies or question formats. I'll emphasize those fixes explicitly so they can present this as \"the solution to your past failures\".\n</think>\n\nHere's the **polished, presentation-ready answer** that addresses your core question while fixing the root cause of your failed evaluations (the \"intens\" typo).
